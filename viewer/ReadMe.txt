KAZAN Viewer 1.4.2

KAZAN Viewer is a freeware tool for viewing and processing data using MatLab GUI (version >= than 6.1). It is written to simplify routine data processing tasks. The source code (Matlab scripts) could be downloaded from <http://www.geocities.com/boep777/kv_intro.html>.

KAZAN Viewer has two main parts: main window (viewer) and data-processing plugins. Viewer has file loader/saver, 1D/stacked 2D/contour/bitmap plots and set of assisting tools. The file loader understands many data formats related to EPR and NMR experiments. Data processing is based on user-written plugins. Plugins can generate output sets of data, which are visualized then by viewer. User writes plugins for his own needs using standard matlab functions. One day the rules for plugin writing will be summarize in the help. Meanwhile one can use plugins that are written by us as example. Data comparison, FFT, simple math, EPR/ENDOR and HYSCORE simulations and some other plugins are included.

We are extensively using Matlab routines from EasySpin toolbox by Stefan Stoll (i.e. apowin, pepper, salt etc). One may find them at <www.esr.ethz.ch>.

Use and modify this program on your own risk. But please leave all author's comments and credits inside. Let us know about changes that can be useful for community.

BTW Kazan is a city in Russia where we came from :).
